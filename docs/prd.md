ArtemisKit — Agent Reliability Toolkit (PRD) 🛡️

One-line: ArtemisKit is a developer-first, JS/TS-native Agent Reliability Toolkit that makes testing, validating, stress-testing, and auditing LLM-driven agents reproducible, auditable, and CI-friendly.
Tagline: Reproducible agent reliability at scale — single core, minimal adapters, many models.
Intro (must-read): Innovation is impactful only when it empowers.

⸻

1. Executive summary 🧭

➡️ Artemis is a CLI-first toolkit (with an optional server/daemon mode) and a set of shared core libraries in TypeScript designed to let engineering, security, and governance teams measure and enforce agent reliability standards. It provides scenario-driven tests, standardized metrics, red-team/adversarial testing, regression comparisons, and artifacted run manifests for audits and CI gates. The platform uses a minimal connector strategy—OpenRouter as the primary adapter, with optional OpenAI and local adapters—so one integration unlocks hundreds of models.

⸻

2. Goals & success criteria 🎯

2.1 Goals

➡️ Provide a reproducible, auditable workflow for evaluating agent reliability across models and versions.
➡️ Keep the adapter surface small while supporting many models.
➡️ Make Artemis CI-native (pre-merge reliability gates) and enterprise-friendly (provenance, RBAC-ready design).
➡️ Facilitate governance (traceability, mitigations, human-in-loop gating).

2.2 Success metrics (KPIs)

🔸 Adoption: number of teams / projects running Artemis in CI within 3 months.
🔸 Coverage: percentage of agent features validated by Artemis test suites for each release.
🔸 Regression detection: mean time to detect regression in model behavior (target < 1 day via CI).
🔸 Repeatability: fraction of runs with reproducible outputs under same seed/environment (target ≥ 95% for deterministic tests).
🔸 Audit readiness: every run produces a run_manifest.json with complete provenance (100% of runs).

⸻

3. Personas & users 👥

➡️ AI Engineers — build and run tests, integrate Artemis into CI.
➡️ Security / Red Team — author adversarial scenarios and analyze failure modes.
➡️ Product/PMs & Governance Officers — view summary reports, approve mitigation actions.
➡️ Analysts / Non-Dev Stakeholders — use server/dashboard to view reports and download artifacts.
➡️ DevOps / SRE — manage deployments, storage, observability, and cost control.

⸻

4. Core value propositions 🧩

➡️ Single canonical runner for automated reliability tests (scriptable + CI).
➡️ Minimal adapters (OpenRouter primary) unlock many models with one integration.
➡️ Standardized run artifacts for auditability and traceability.
➡️ Extensible scorer architecture (deterministic matchers, LLM graders, human-in-loop).
➡️ Red-team tooling and severity-mapped mitigations integrated with results.

⸻

5. Scope (MVP vs. future) 🔬

MVP (must-have)

🔹 TypeScript core libraries (art-core), CLI (artemis): init, run, compare, report, export.
🔹 OpenRouter adapter (primary) + optional OpenAI adapter.
🔹 Scenario YAML format, deterministic runner, seeding.
🔹 Evaluation matchers: exact, regex, fuzzy (Levenshtein), and LLM-grader hook.
🔹 run_manifest.json with full provenance.
🔹 JSON report output + HTML summary generator.
🔹 GitHub Actions example CI flow (fail on regression).
🔹 Basic red-team generator module (mutations + LLM-suggested prompts).
🔹 Storage: local filesystem + S3 (artifact push).
🔹 Logging + minimal Prometheus metrics exporter.

Post-MVP (should-have / nice-to-have)

🔹 Server/daemon mode with REST API and lightweight dashboard.
🔹 Streaming responses support, concurrency/stress harness.
🔹 Multi-tenant / RBAC support.
🔹 Plugins for additional adapters (Hugging Face, Anthropic) and local LLM runtimes.

6. High-level architecture 🏗️

CLI / Server (artemis)
      ↓
art-core (TS lib)  <——— adapters (openrouter-adapter, openai-adapter, local-adapter)
  • Runner
  • Scenario Engine
  • Evaluators
  • Metrics
  • Artifact Manager
  • Provenance Manager
      ↓
Storage (local / S3 / GCS) & CI integrations
      ↓
Observability (Prometheus) + Dashboard (optional)

Key design principles

➡️ Single internal ModelClient interface — all consumers call this.
➡️ Adapters are thin and implement only generate, stream, embed, and capabilities().
➡️ CLI is canonical; server imports core libraries — no duplicated logic.
➡️ Full provenance in artifacts to support audit & governance.

⸻

7. API / Interfaces (developer contract) ⚙️

7.1 TypeScript ModelClient interface (summary)

export type GenerateOpts = {
  prompt: string | ChatMessage[]; // supports chat and plain
  model?: string;
  maxTokens?: number;
  temperature?: number;
  functions?: any[];
  stream?: boolean;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
};

export type GenerateResult = {
  id: string;
  model: string;
  text: string;
  tokens: { prompt: number; completion: number; total: number };
  latencyMs: number;
  raw?: any; // original provider response
};

export interface ModelClient {
  generate(opts: GenerateOpts): Promise<GenerateResult>;
  stream?(opts: GenerateOpts, onChunk: (chunk: string) => void): AsyncIterable<string>;
  embed?(text: string): Promise<number[]>;
  capabilities(): Promise<{ streaming: boolean; functionCalling: boolean; maxContext: number }>;
  close?(): Promise<void>;
}

7.2 Scenario (YAML) schema (high-level)

name: string
description: string
model: openrouter/model-name
seed: int
cases:
  - id: string
    prompt: string | chat[]
    expected:
      type: exact|regex|fuzzy|llm_grader|custom
      value: string
      threshold: number
    tags: [policy, privacy]
    metadata: {}


⸻

8. CLI UX & commands (canonical) 🧭

10. Evaluation & metrics definitions ✅

Provide both primitive and composite metrics:

🔹 Success Rate — fraction of cases meeting expected matcher threshold.
🔹 Hallucination Rate — fraction of responses with unsupported facts (detected via retrieval/KB checks or manual/human label).
🔹 Instruction-Following Score — normalized score across instruction-following tests.
🔹 Robustness (Perturbation Delta) — drop in performance when prompts are perturbed.
🔹 Latency (p50/p95/p99) — response time distribution.
🔹 Reproducibility Score — fraction of runs producing identical outputs under same seed.
🔹 Regression Delta — difference between historic baseline and current run (supports thresholds to block merges).

⸻

11. Red-team & adversarial testing 🛡️

Features

➡️ Mutation primitives: typos, role-spoof, instruction-flip, chain-of-thought injection.
➡️ LLM-based adversarial prompt generator (optional) to propose candidate attacks.
➡️ Severity mapping: low / medium / high with mitigation suggestions.
➡️ Automated triage: add failing cases to a “quarantine suite” for human review.

Outputs

🔹 redteam.json with case-level severity and suggested mitigations.
🔹 integration hook to add critical failures to incident trackers (e.g., create GitHub issue or PagerDuty incident via webhook).

⸻

12. Governance, privacy & security 🔐

➡️ Provenance-first: every run must include git commit, runner identity, config, seed, and runtime metadata.
➡️ PII handling: configurable redaction pipeline (patterns + regex + manual redaction). Store hashed references only.
➡️ Access controls: API keys for adapters stored via secrets manager; token rotation & audit logs.
➡️ Data retention: configurable retention policy (e.g., default 90 days) and purge capabilities.
➡️ Policy mapping: map failure type → policy action (e.g., “High hallucination” → block deployment until fixed).
➡️ Secure defaults: do not log full prompts by default in public logs; use hashed prompt references.

⸻

13. CI/CD & deployment model 🔁

CI patterns

➡️ Pre-merge gate: run sampled critical scenarios, fail on regressions above thresholds.
➡️ Nightly runs: full suites for teams to monitor drift.
➡️ Promote to staging: require explicit approval if regression exists.

Example GH Actions job (summary)
	•	Checkout, install, build.
	•	Run artemis run --config smoke.yml --out run-smoke.json.
	•	Run artemis compare baseline.json run-smoke.json --fail-if-delta > configured threshold.
	•	Upload run artifacts to S3 / Actions artifacts and post results to PR.

Deployment modes

🔸 Local CLI (developer).
🔸 Containerized server/daemon (Kubernetes / ECS) for scheduled runs and dashboard.
🔸 Managed SaaS/enterprise integration (future).

⸻

14. Observability & logging 📈

➡️ Structured JSON logs, with log levels.
➡️ Prometheus metrics: artemis_runs_total, artemis_failures_total, artemis_latency_ms_bucket.
➡️ Tracing: optional OpenTelemetry spans for long runs.
➡️ Dashboards: Grafana-ready dashboards for key metrics (p50/p95 latency, success rate trend, new regressions).

⸻

15. Non-functional requirements (NFRs) ⚙️

🔸 Performance: support concurrent workers; stress harness that can run 50+ parallel calls for stress testing.
🔸 Scalability: artifact storage must scale (S3/GCS).
🔸 Reliability: deterministic seeding; containerized runners to ensure reproducibility.
🔸 Extensibility: plugin adapter system for new providers.
🔸 Portability: run locally, CI, or containerized cluster.
🔸 Usability: easy CLI and human-readable HTML reports.

⸻

16. Security review checklist 🔍

➡️ Secrets out of code (env or secret store).
➡️ Prompt redaction enabled by default.
➡️ Least privilege for storage buckets.
➡️ Regular dependency scanning (Snyk/Dependabot).
➡️ Pen-test on server mode before production use.
➡️ Ensure telemetry doesn’t leak PII by default.

⸻

17. Acceptance criteria & QA plan ✅

17.1 Acceptance criteria (MVP)

🔹 artemis run executes a scenario file and emits run_manifest.json with required fields.
🔹 OpenRouter adapter can generate text and return a GenerateResult with latency and tokens.
🔹 artemis compare outputs metric deltas and indicates pass/fail against thresholds.
🔹 CI example workflow runs and fails a PR if regression threshold exceeded.
🔹 HTML report generates with summary metrics and per-case details.
🔹 Redaction pipeline masks PII in stored artifacts by default.

17.2 QA testing

➡️ Unit tests for runner, matchers, and adapters.
➡️ Integration tests with mocked provider responses (recorded fixtures).
➡️ E2E smoke test using a cheap model via OpenRouter with deterministic seed.
➡️ Manual red-team session with security team for adversarial suite validation.

⸻

19. Costs & operational considerations 💸

➡️ OpenRouter routing may add middle-layer costs; measure per-call fees and latency. Keep an optional direct OpenAI adapter for enterprise.
➡️ CI runs should sample intelligently to reduce cost; support configurable sampling rates for different CI events.
➡️ Storage: long-term artifact retention costs; supply retention policy and archiving.
➡️ Estimate: relative MVP dev effort ~ 4–8 engineer-weeks for sprints 0–4 (single full-stack engineer + 1 part-time QA). Provide a refined estimate when team composition is known.

⸻

20. Risks & mitigations ⚠️

🔸 Noisy LLM graders — mitigation: version rubrics, fallback to human review, thresholding.
🔸 Model non-determinism — mitigation: seeds, store runtime metadata, sample multiple runs.
🔸 PII leakage — mitigation: default redaction and hashed prompt refs.
🔸 Vendor lock-in — mitigation: keep adapters thin and provider-agnostic ModelClient.
🔸 Cost spikes — mitigation: sampling, budget limits, and provider cost-estimation hooks.
